abstract: Across the entirety of human history, societies have conceived a plethora of different beliefs to support their ideologies. But why is it that the human being has come to give up part of its intrinsic individuality for a predetermined set of principles? Let us take and study the case of Confucianism, a doctrine which dominated and set an ideological foundation across the Eastern Asian region more than 27 centuries ago. I will now attempt to explore the theoretical principles of Confucianism and its development throughout history to finally conclude whether there really exists indeed a contemporary and relevant effect over major social and/or political fields.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
