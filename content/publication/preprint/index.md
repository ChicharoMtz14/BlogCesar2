abstract: Up until 2021's second trimester, Mexico's GDP was valued at an estimated $311,457 million USD dollars, making it the 15th largest in the world. The state of Nuevo León, notable for its industrial activity, accounted for 7.6% of such quantity. However, these numbers' accuracy relies greatly on uncertain estimations due to unregulated, informal economic activities. Such scenario ultimately begs the question about the potentially negative socioeconomic effects that this matter could carry for the state's population and economic performance, which is thoroughly addressed in this article. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The Mexican state of Nuevo León has been notable for its economic performance in the past decade within the Latin American context. But to what extent have said efforts been hindered by nationwide issues, mainly economic informality?
