Greetings! Thanks for coming to take a look. Welcome to my own personal internet corner where I often post my thoughts regarding my favorite subjects in both academic and everyday-life scenarios. I also share this platform with others who wish to state something to the world. Chill, this is not about being intellectual all the time, I'll advise you when matters get serious. Enjoy your stay and hit me up if youâ€™ve got something for me (or even if you donâ€™t, I've always got time for a nice chat).
